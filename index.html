                    <li> <a href="https://www.vote.org/register-to-vote/" target="_blank">Register to Vote ASAP</a></li>
                    <li> <a href="https://www.nass.org/can-i-vote/voter-registration" target="_blank">Double check you are still registered (some states have purged voting records)</a></li>
                    <li> <a href="https://voterrecords.com/" target="_blank"> Check if your friends voted </a></li>

            <h5>N.B. There are a lot of people with exceptional circumstances who are unable to vote even though they want to. This movement is targeting all your friends who can vote but choose not to.</h5>

                <p>Creator's notes: <br/> <br/>With luck, this will be the <a href="http://www.alsa.org/fight-als/ice-bucket-challenge.html" target="_blank"> Ice Bucket Challenge </a> of voter turnout. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harlem_Shake_(meme)" target="_blank">Harlem Shake</a> of election news. The <a href="https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/tide-pod-challenge/" target="_blank">Tide Pod Challenge</a> of political activism. This election season let's try a different way to increase voter turnout. Let's try using peer pressure. I know you are passionate about influencing our modern political agenda and our elected representatives. Be brave! Take a stand on this issue with your friends. If they don't vote, that's a dealbreaker for your friendship. #VOTEORSILENCE</p>
